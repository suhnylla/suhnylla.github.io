    <h1>Where are we in the Wealth Management space today?</h1>
    <h2>Initiatives by regulators can only go so far..</h2>
    <p>The world after the 2008 global financial crisis changed everything significantly! Where we once thought banks were invincible - they weren't. Where we once may have assumed bankers designed relevant financial products to meet customer needs - we now know that unless that was for the purpose of meeting some internal 'KPI' - they definately didn't! And where we.. for such a long time - assumed 'the professionals' were so smart, they knew it all - trust me, every single assumption - out the window! we!</p>
    <p>Short of trying to figure out who was to blame, and if our systems (eventually) did serve us right - let me talk about what actually rose from the ashes....in 4 or 5 simple letters - idea(s). More specifically - executable ideas. The enables, you might ask? Well - technology (programming languages that enabled AirBnB for example, or UBER.., data pipes or infrastructure (as well call it), and a whole bunch of people who needed better solutions, faster, better, cheaper - witness the world we all live in today (quite different from the one in  2008). Kickstarter! Lending Tree. Betterment! Lemonade! Alipay! Amazon! Better and more secure payment and cloud providers. EveryY single thing that the mind could conceive - the clicks at the ends of our fingertips - gave us!  </p>
    <p>The world we live in today - at the click of a button. Our waking hours. The journey to the office - probably more like a cup of coffee than the cubicle of yesteryear. Our flight and hotel/AirBnB bookings. Alexa, siri - PA services we never thought we needed - we now can't live without! </p>
    <p>But wait! What has any of this got to do with the global financial crisis of 2008, you might ask? Everything. Your money in the bank today -could quite easily sit as data on a service platform - that is what bitcoin is, really! Bits and pieces of zero's and one's. Paperwork? Invoices, ledgers, purchase orders - blockchain can record and maintain for far longer, and with far better integrity than any accountant out there. Money management? Ahhh - just look at Motif or Betterment. our Roboadvisors - again, at the same click of a button. A paradox at play, almost. Everything so connected. And distant...at the same time. Parallel worlds in any other context..... </p>
    <p>So the point you might ask? Only this - technology enablers + free will = infinite opportunities. To do good. To do better than those who came before us...because, we simply have no other choice. Or rather - we no longer have excuses... </p>
